# Looks for steep discount bookings on apahotel.com
There is a hotel in Japan that will give the insanely low price of $40 per night if you book a 30 day chunk all at once. Their website only lets you search a single location one day at a time, and it's difficult in japanese so I made this. The most ironic part is they discontinued the offer as soon as I was done. I was going to make a frontend but that's scrapped.

A youtube of the first time I ran it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGUOLdaKBuE
